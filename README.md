This is a personal website that I wanted to do to improve my frontend skills using a youtube video. I did add personal touches to this website, different pictures, hovers, etc.

## Summary
The source I used to create this website was through a youtube video.

### Software used:
Visual Studio Code and
Boxicons for icons : https://boxicons.com/?query=menu

### What I learn:
I learned how to make a responsive website without necessarily needing biolerplate. I just found out through the video that
I could have created my intro section and navigation barin the header section.
I can use flex-basis to even out sections that is within the same division, such as about1 and about 2 section.

When I created the class showmenu in html file, without get any showmenu class you start coding in css and .js file , and its working. This was because
Show menu class gets toggled on and off using js when the hamburger icon is clicked. If you add showmenu directly in html then the menu will be opened all the time that's why I am toggling this using js. Thia is how you create dynamic webpage.

Beautify file on VSCODE can be useful to make the code more organized and clean.

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. How to make animate.css for websites to work

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. When I first started building up the website, it wouldnt show on the browser. 
2. Everything was squeezed together and wouldnot spread out.

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. I had to cancel the Visual Studio Code out and then reopen it to the website foldery. It finnaly showed but then there was another problem.
2. I realized I had margin: with a small number which was a typo. Once I deleted that it spreaded out perfectly.

#### Weakness so far:
1.	flexbox is my weakness
