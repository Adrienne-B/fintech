This is a personal website that I wanted to do to improve my frontend skills using a youtube video.

## Summary
The source I used to create this website was through a youtube video.

### Software used:
Visual Studio Code

### What I learn:
I learned how to make a responsive website without necessarily needing biolerplate. I just found out through the video that
I could have created my intro section and navigation barin the header section.
I can use flex-basis to even out sections that is within the same division, such as about1 and about 2 section.

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. How to make animate.css for websites to work

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. When I first started building up the website, it wouldnt show on the browser. 
2. Everything was squeezed together and wouldnot spread out.

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. I had to cancel the Visual Studio Code out and then reopen it to the website foldery. It finnaly showed but then there was another problem.
2. I realized I had margin: with a small number which was a typo. Once I deleted that it spreaded out perfectly.

#### Weakness so far:
1.	flexbox is my weakness
